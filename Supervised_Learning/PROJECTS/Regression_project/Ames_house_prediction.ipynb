    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**  \n",
    "    - Define the objective: Predict house sale prices using the Ames Housing Dataset.\n",
    "    - Review dataset features and target variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - Select relevant features for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  \n",
    "    - Analyze the distribution of the target variable (SalePrice).\n",
    "    - Examine correlations between features and SalePrice.\n",
    "    - Visualize relationships for both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "    - Assess the impact of engineered features.\n",

    "The Ames Housing Dataset is a comprehensive collection of residential property data from Ames, Iowa, USA. Widely recognized in the machine learning and data science communities, this dataset provides detailed information on 2,930 homes, described by 79 features encompassing both numerical and categorical variables. The primary objective of this project is to analyze these features and develop predictive models for the target variable, **SalePrice**, which represents the sale price of each house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we will explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, conduct exploratory data analysis, and apply machine learning techniques to predict housing prices. This analysis will demonstrate practical approaches to regression modeling, feature engineering, and predictive analytics within the real estate domain.\n",
